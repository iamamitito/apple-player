                [00:04.40] Open-minded, I'm so blinded
                [00:08.50] Mystery man, woman phantom
                [00:12.60] Violet light smears the atmosphere
                [00:16.40] I'm so scared, but I'm standing here
                [00:21.00] Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
                [00:29.00] Is it all just virtual?
                [00:32.00] We could be lovers, even just tonight
                [00:36.00] We could be anything you want
                [00:40.40] We could be jokers, brought to the daylight
                [00:45.00] We could break all of our stigma
                [00:48.10] I'll, I'll be your enigma
                [00:52.50] I'll, I'll be your enigma
                [00:56.50] I'll, I'll be your enigma
                [01:00.50] I'll, I'll be your enigma
                [01:06.50] Can't stop staring, I'm so naked
                [01:10.50] Wrapped in shadows, my heart races
                [01:14.50] Dragon's eyes watch, goddess breathing
                [01:19.00] Give me something to believe in
                [01:23.00] Is what I am seeing real, or is it just a sign?
                [01:31.20] Is it all just virtual?

                [02:08.20] Did you hear what I said?
                [02:10.00] What?
                [02:10.50] Did you hear what I said?
                [02:12.00] Yeah
                [02:13.00] Is it all in my head?
